<p> China's Aviation sector experienced significant growth in the first half of this year, with nearly 350 million passenger trips recorded, representing a remarkable surge of 23.5 percent compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) revealed that domestic routes accounted for 320 million of these trips, reflecting an increase of 16.4 percent year on year. Meanwhile, international routes saw an extraordinary rise, with more than 29.67 million trips, which is an impressive jump of 254.4 percent from the previous year.

<p>In addition to passenger travel, the civil aviation market also reported strong performance in freight transport. The total freight volume surpassed 4.17 million tonnes during the same period, marking a year-on-year increase of 27.4 percent. Domestic freight transport rose by 23.2 percent, while international freight saw an even larger increase of 34.3 percent, underscoring the sector's recovery and growing demand.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, China's immigration authority highlighted a significant uptick in trips made by foreign travelers during the first half of the year, attributed to measures introduced in January aimed at facilitating the entry of foreign nationals. These measures include expanded visa-free policies, relaxed visa application requirements, and simplified entry procedures for business, education, and tourism purposes.</p>

<p>Xu Qing, the deputy head of the transport department at CAAC, expressed optimism for continued growth in domestic passenger transport in the second half of the year, alongside further recovery in international travel. "We expect the main indicators of the civil aviation transportation market to reach new highs this year," Xu stated at a recent press conference. This positive outlook reflects the resilience of China's aviation sector as it continues to adapt and rebound in the post-pandemic landscape.</p>
