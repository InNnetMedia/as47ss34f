<p>French energy giant TotalEnergies said on Monday it was withdrawing from two offshore gas fields in South Africa as they did not appear economically viable.</p>

<p>A subsidiary of TotalEnergies owns a 45 per cent stake in a block off the country’s southern coast where the fields, Brulpadda and Luiperd, were discovered.</p>

<p>TotalEnergies said they could “not be turned into a commercial development as it appeared to be too challenging to economically develop and monetise these gas discoveries for the South African market.”</p>

<p>The block, spanning 19,000 square kilometres (7,335 square miles), is located 175km (109 miles) off the South African south coast.</p>

<p>Qatar Petroleum, which holds a 25 per cent interest in the block, also announced its intention to withdraw from the project, said Africa Energy Corp, a Canadian oil and gas exploration company with a 10 per cent stake through a subsidiary.</p>

<p>Another partner, CNR International which owns 20 per cent of the block, had announced its departure earlier in July.</p>

<p>Africa Energy Corp said it did not intend to withdraw from the project and noted that under a joint agreement, companies that pull out of the block would give up their stakes for free to those that stay.</p>

<p>The company said the gas fields were “the largest discoveries of natural gas resources in South Africa.”</p>

<p>It added, “If developed, it could supply a significant portion of the country’s energy needs as it seeks to transition away from coal-fired power plants.”</p>

<p>Environmental groups have opposed the project, warning that drilling in the deep waters would threaten the region’s biodiversity and fishermen.</p>
