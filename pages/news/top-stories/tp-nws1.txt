<p>Vehicle hijackings have surged in South Africa in 2024, deeply unsettling motorists nationwide. Cartrack, a leading car-tracking company, reports that the theft of car components now outpaces the theft of entire vehicles. This trend is driven by a high demand for affordable, readily available parts on the black market, as these parts are easier to conceal and harder to trace than whole cars.</p>
<p>Motorists have adopted various safety measures, including installing multiple tracking devices, parking in well-lit areas, and practicing increased vigilance. However, as Siyakha Masiye, spokesperson at MiWay, points out, carjackers are becoming more sophisticated.</p>

<p>“Despite numerous safety measures, carjackers are evolving their techniques,” Masiye says.
Internal data from MiWay reveals that the most frequently stolen accessories include:<br>

1.Car wheels<br>
2.Wheel caps<br>
3.Car batteries<br>
4.Sound equipment<br>
5.Vehicle mirrors<br>
6.Headlights</p>

<p>Airbags, batteries, tailgates, wheels, and tires are among the most stolen parts, largely due to their ease of concealment and difficulty in tracing.</p>

<p>The estimated trade value of stolen car parts in chop shops is about R442 million, making reselling these parts a lucrative and less traceable enterprise compared to reselling whole vehicles. Even some car mechanics have engaged in this unlawful practice, occasionally replacing parts with faulty, cheaper ones during repairs.</p>

<p>To safeguard against seasoned thieves, motorists can take several precautions. Equipping wheels with locknuts, reinforcing battery brackets, parking in busy and well-lit areas, and double-checking vehicle locks are essential steps. Keeping valuables out of sight, avoiding high-risk areas, steering clear of unfamiliar Wi-Fi networks from the car, and maintaining vigilance can also help. Installing a GPS tracker is advisable, ensuring the vehicle can be located if stolen or hijacked.</p>
