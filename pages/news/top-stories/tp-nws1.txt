<p>A look at the latest price projections for South Africa’s motorists for August 2024 shows some mixed news for petrol and diesel vehicle owners.</p>
<p>Motorists have adopted various safety measures, including installing multiple tracking devices, parking in well-lit areas, and practicing increased vigilance. However, as Siyakha Masiye, spokesperson at MiWay, points out, carjackers are becoming more sophisticated.</p>

<p>While petrol is forecast to see a slight decrease, diesel may well become more expensive at the pumps next month.</P>

<p>As reported by The South African website, there was welcome news last week following a price decrease for both petrol and diesel.</p>

<p>Below, the latest projections as received by The South African website from the CEF, effective Thursday, 18 July.</p>

<p>If the market conditions were to remain consistent for the remainder of the month – an unlikely scenario with the rand/dollar exchange rate ever fluctuating and the oil price changing – a decrease of 3 cents is expected for petrol 93 octane motorists and a decrease of 7 cents for 95 users.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, diesel motorists would see something between a 7 cents per litre decrease and a 6 cents per litre increase.</p>

<p>Finally, illuminating paraffin is expected to decrease by 1 cent.</p>
