<p>South African motorists are familiar with the occasional roadblock, particularly those residing in Gauteng.</p>

<p>With the general elections concluded and new measures starting to take effect, various departments are intensifying their efforts to tackle significant issues in the country.</p>

<p>According to BusinessTech, in 2014, an average of 40 people died daily on the roads, with around 184 sustaining serious injuries.</p>

<p>Despite an increase in population and vehicles on the roads by 2024, the figures have improved to 34 deaths and 157 injuries daily.</p>

<p>However, there is always more to be done to ensure the safety of South African road users.</p>

<p>Nearly 10% of registered vehicles in South Africa are deemed not roadworthy, which increases the risk of accidents and fatalities.</p>

<p>The Department of Transport (DoT) has announced plans to implement a new strategy, which will involve traffic police working around the clock in shifts by March 2025.</p>

<p>The Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) has noted that while the decline in road fatalities is encouraging, significant work remains to be done.</p>

<p>The government appears to be making systematic changes to address these issues.</p>

<p>“Human factors accounted for 80% of all deaths during the festive period, but this human factor—or driver behavior—will only change over time. Our ongoing call is for the government to ensure more law enforcers are deployed to patrol our roads. Additionally, more education and awareness campaigns should be conducted throughout the year to prioritize road safety. The dire road safety situation in South Africa is a national crisis that costs the economy around R200 billion annually, according to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC). Improving road safety will benefit all South Africans, and it is now up to the government to take decisive action to improve the situation,” said the Automobile Association of South Africa (AA).</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister of Transport, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, has committed to removing obstacles that hinder the implementation of visible traffic policing to address lawlessness during his tenure.</p>

<p>Currently, only the Western Cape and the National Traffic Police operate on a 24/7 shift system.</p>

<p>During his inaugural address, Hlengwa stated that the administration will expedite the resolution of issues delaying the nationwide implementation of this system to provide visible traffic law enforcement around the clock.</p>

<p>He also assured that his department would oversee and ensure the introduction of the new system by 31 March 2025.</p>

<p>Road fatalities have decreased from 12,554 in 2020 to 11,883 in 2023.</p>
