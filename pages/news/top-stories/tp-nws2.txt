<h1>The expected petrol and diesel prices for August 2024 – UPDATED</h1>
<img src="../pages/news/news-images copy/aviation/tp-nws1.jpg" alt="Story image">

<p>The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) is expected to cut interest rates by up to 150 basis points by mid-year 2025, which could result in the average car owner with vehicle asset finance saving R308 per month on their repayments.</p>

<p>The South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB’s) Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep rates unchanged in May, maintaining the repo rate at 8.25% and the prime lending rate at 11.75%.</p>

<p>Economists anticipate that the SARB will maintain the rates at 8.25% when the Monetary Policy Committee convenes in July.</p>

<p>They are hopeful that interest rate cuts will be postponed until the September meeting.</p>

<p>This maximum forecast of 150bps will bring much-needed relief for car owners with loans in South Africa, and it’s expected to commence as soon as November.</p>

<p>Interest rates have remained unchanged since the last policy rate decision a year ago, adding to the financial strain on households that have also faced other cost increases, such as electricity, fuel, and property rates.</p>

<p>According to WesBank, the average amount for a new vehicle financed through their institution was approximately R410,000.</p>
<p>This means that individuals who purchased a car at this value and secured a loan at current rates will pay R270 less per month on their repayments at a forecasted prime rate of 10.25% by July 2025.</p>

<p>However, this saving diminishes as the price of the car increases.</p>

<p>For instance, those who bought an R500,000 car will pay R375 less per month, while those who purchased a R1 million car will enjoy a more substantial reduction of R750 per month.</p>

<p>The table below highlights how much you’ll save on your bond every month if the forecasted 150 bps interest rate cuts come into effect next year.</p>

<p>Several auto motor stakeholders have noted that decisions to hold interest rates are disappointing and that the new vehicle market needs a rate cut.</p>

<p>Year-to-date, new vehicle sales have declined 7.4% to 246,052 units, leaving the possibility that the market will fail to reach 500,000 units this year.</p>

<p>“Vehicle price inflation, high interest rates, and the general rising costs of living are all impacting the ability of new car buyers to enter or stay in the market,” said Lebo Gaoaketse, Head of Marketing and Communication at WesBank.</p>

<p>“Until there is some relief in interest rates, greater incentive deals from manufacturers, or a significant shift in general inflation or earnings, the new vehicle market will continue to remain under pressure,” he added.</p>

<p>In the automotive industry, the impact of lower interest rates cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>This financial shift would encourage consumers to make significant purchases, ultimately driving up sales and providing crucial support to businesses throughout the supply chain.</p>

<p>The implications wouldn’t just stop at the property and car sales sectors. A noteworthy reduction in interest rates would have extensive positive ramifications for the broader economy.</p>

<p>The resulting surge in consumer spending would lead to a noticeable uptick in demand, thereby triggering heightened production levels, facilitating job creation, and fostering a more robust economic outlook.</p>
