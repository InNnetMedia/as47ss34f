<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The A5 Sportback four-door adds more practicality and better fuel economy to the list of winning ingredients that go into making the A5 coupe. That makes it easy to recommend to new-car shoppers and a shoo-in for our 2024 Editors' Choice awards. The Sportback variant uses an identical powertrain setup to the A5: a turbocharged inline-four bolted to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. The engine in the entry-level A5 Sportback 40 makes 201 horsepower, and the A5 Sportback 45 model gains 60 more ponies. The 45 especially is a fun driver that isn’t as aggressive as the 349-hp S5 Sportback, which we review separately. Even the base model comes with plush amenities like leather seating, a panoramic sunroof, and moody ambient lighting. Its enduring design is perhaps a touch too mild, and rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz C-class and the Genesis G70 have arguably more stylish interiors. The Audi makes up for this with excellent tech features like the available digital gauge display and navigation boasting Google Earth imagery.</p>

<p>New standard features join the entire lineup. All models come with a heated steering wheel with hands-on detection, adaptive cruise control, active lane assist, and parking sensors. Two changes apply to all A5 Sportback trims except for the entry-level Sportback 40: Remote start is accessible in the MyAudi app; and on the exterior color palette, Progressive Red Metallic replaces Tango Red. Cars equipped with the Navigation Package—optional on Premium Plus, standard above that—gain the benefit of traffic sign recognition and adaptive cruise control. Navigation unlocks a six-month subscription to the more full-featured Audi Connect Plus and Audi app store, a native software interface for everything from weather and news to gaming and parking.</p>

<p>The price of the 2024 Audi A5 Sedan / Sportback starts at $47 295 and goes up to $56 795 depending on the trim and options.</p>

<p>Every 2024 A5 Sportback comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder available in two outputs. Models wearing the 40 badge make 201 horsepower; the 45s make 261 horses. Power goes through a standard seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and standard Quattro all-wheel drive. We haven't tested the newest model year yet. However, we called the last-generation engine that made 252 hp “one of the best of its ilk.” We stand by that, and believe nine more horses is just a little more of a really good thing. In our tests, the previous-generation sedan got from zero to 60 mph in 5.0 seconds. The updated 45 trim should be similarly quick. The A5 Sportback starts with the supple, confident driving experience of the A5 coupe, then adds two more doors and extra luggage space. The longer wheelbase bestows even more composure over potholes and broken roads, especially when equipped with the optional adaptive suspension. Four adults can enjoy a long trip and scenic detours on curvy roads along the way.</p>

<h3>Fuel Economy</h3>
<p>The EPA estimates the A5 Sportback will earn up to 26 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway. While we haven't tested a new A5 Sportback on our real-world highway fuel-economy route, an older model we evaluated returned 34 mpg during that test. For more information about the A5 Sportback's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.</p>



<h3>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo space</h3>

<p>Remembering that the A5 Sportback is a seductive take on the A4 sedan helps manage luxury expectations. Audi makes sure to please the eyes, building in high quality materials, top notch fit and finish, and a bundle of high-end features that distance the A5 from mainstream sedans. All A5 Sportback models come well equipped with luxury frills such as power front seats, leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, ambient interior lighting, and three-zone climate control. Some of the price-point compromises include manual steering-column adjustment and thin padding in places like the armrests. A hatchback in disguise, the A5 Sportback's sloping rear roofline hides a power-operated liftgate and a large cargo hold, making it far more practical than the Audi A4 sedan or the A5 coupe and convertible. It proved its mettle in our carry-on suitcase testing by accommodating 16 cases despite having a smallish cargo area according to the numbers. In fact, the Sportback beat all of its direct rivals in our real-world cargo test.</p>

<p>All A5 Sportback trims come with a 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen display showing Audi’s MMI system. One of the most pleasing infotainment systems among premium brands, it’s easy to use while on the go and comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration. Control is by fingtertip or a small dial between the driver and front-seat passenger next to the gear shift lever. MMI is made even better by the A5 Sportback's optional—and highly recommended—12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge display that can mirror much of the main display. A5 Sportbacks equipped with navigation come with access to a suite of internet and vehicle-connectivity features called Audi Connect Plus that introduces new features this year.
