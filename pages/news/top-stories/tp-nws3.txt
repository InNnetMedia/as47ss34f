<p>Red Bull Racing has been an unstoppable force in Formula 1 over the past few years, with ace Max Verstappen snatching three straight World Drivers' Championships. But Red Bull isn't satisfied with its F1 dominance and now wants to conquer the world of exclusive, ultra-expensive track-only hypercars, revealing the sleek RB17 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.</p>

<p>The RB17 is designed by Adrian Newey, the same man responsible for both the F1 racers that have led Verstappen to 61 career wins and the wild V-12-powered Aston Martin Valkyrie. While the Valkyrie is road legal, the RB17 is not, but both slippery machines share an intense focus on aerodynamics and ballistic powertrains.</p>

<p>Built around a carbon-fiber monocoque, the RB17 is motivated by a mid-mounted, naturally aspirated 4.5-liter V-10 that wails to a 15,000-rpm redline and is used as a stressed member of the chassis. The 1000-hp Cosworth-built engine is assisted by a 200-hp e-motor for a grand total of 1200 horsepower, routed to the rear wheels through a carbon fiber six-speed sequential gearbox. The transmission is designed and developed in house but uses gears made by Xtrac, and the e-motor is used for first gear and reverse. Red Bull says the two-seater weighs under 1984 pounds.</p>

<p>Red Bull says the RB17 is capable of setting lap times that are equivalent to those completed by F1 cars, and top speed is said to be over 217 mph. Key to setting those lap times is the active pushrod suspension at each corner with active height and roll control. Red Bull is also working with Michelin to develop three different tire compounds. There will be two slick tires—one with more extreme levels of grip and one that allows for more slip angle—and a treaded tire. The RB17 also uses hydraulically assisted power steering and has carbon brakes at each wheel.</p>

<p>Another crucial factor to F1-fighting lap times is the aerodynamics. Like the Valkyrie, the bodywork hides a series of channels and tunnels that allow the air to flow through the car and let Red Bull avoid sticking a clunky, drag-adding rear wing atop the rear deck. Instead, the rear wing sits low and wraps around a massive rear diffuser. Both the front and rear wings feature active elements, and Red Bull is aiming for 3748 pounds of downforce at 150 mph.</p>

<p>The development process has been long, with work beginning at the end of 2020, and Newey told Top Gear that the car has actually gone through three different versions with three engines, originally starting out with the e-motor on the front axle for all-wheel drive. The interior is still being worked out, but Newey said that it will have plenty of physical buttons and won't be a bare bones race car. The passenger seat is staggered slightly, and there luggage space up from and room for a pair of helmets behind the cabin.</p>

<p>The powertrain is currently being perfected on the dynamometer, and Red Bull aims for the car to have its on-track debut next summer. Red Bull Advanced Technologies will build just 50 examples of the RB17. Each car will be completely bespoke, and owners will be invited to a series of track days at the world's premier circuits. According to Top Gear, the RB17 will cost the equivalent of over $6 million.</p>
